# Europe OSS

## What is it?

Europe OSS is an initiative to bring together the Open Source Software ecosystem in Europe.

Official initial efforts will be launched early 2020.

## Why?

Europe is a continent thriving with software innovation. Unfourtunately it all happens in isolated islands spread around the continent.

Berlin, Amsterdam, Brussels, Prague, Rome, Barcelona... 

By exposing and bringing these places together, we can support each other, collaborate and discuss, altogether shaping a brighter future for the digital Europe.

## I want to help!
